Additional assumptions:

    No duplicate keys are allowed in input JSON string.
    Empty json key-value pairs like '"a": {}' will be replaced with '"a": null' in the output.

To run it, please do a maven package by:

    mvn clean package

Then run it by giving a text file:

    cat test.json | java -jar target/flatjson-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

or directly:

    java -jar target/flatjson-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

To run the tests, please do:

    mvn test

Have fun! :)
